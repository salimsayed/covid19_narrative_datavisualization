<h1 style="text-align: center;width: 900px;">The fury of Covid19</h1>
<p>
  Covid19 is one of the biggest calamities of 20th century which has impacted people of every country, state, race, religion and economic conditions.
  In USA 4.3M people got infected and 149,000 people have died of this pandemic. All states of USA are impacted, some acted aggressively to contain the infection but some
  ignored it until it was on their door steps. Across all the states in US, one theme clearly appears that people of poor economic condition are much more impacted than the people who are well off.
  In the US there is a huge gap in the education and economic progress among the communities of color. Unstable families, racial bias, poor living conditions, poor education facilities,
  lack of support and motivation for teens leads a generation of people who are less skilled, economically backward, more prone to substance abuse and higher incarceration rate.
  This also has a significant impact on the ability to combat natural disasters like Covid19. Lets first see the <a href="income_inequality.html">income inequality</a> among Americans across their races.
